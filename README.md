# DegUIL [ECML-PKDD, 2023] 

The repository provides PyTorch code and datasets for our paper "DegUIL: Degree-aware Graph Neural Networks
for Long-tailed User Identity Linkage", which is published in 23'ECML-PKDD.

## 1. Requirements
- PyTorch >= 1.8.1+cu111
- Python 3.8.5
- Numpy 1.19.5
- nltk 3.6.1
- tqdm 4.60.0

To install, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Our code is run in GPU by default (CUDA 11.1+ here) , you can change the device into CPU if only CPU is available.

## 2. Repository Strucutre
- datasets/: contains the datasets FT(Foursquare-Twitter) and DBLP(DBLP17-DBLP19), which come from open source. The `bestEmbs` folder stores the mapped embeddings of two networks when getting the best performance.  
- layers/: model layers
- models/: main modules of our model DegUIL
- utils:/ tool functions for processing data and logging
- config.py: hyperparameters
- DegUIL.py: main file

## 3. Usage
```python
# FT dataset
python Node2Vec/run_node2vec.py -- dataset FT   # get emb_n2v1.pkl
python DegUIL.py --dataset FT --mu 0.001 --lr 5e-4

# DBLP dataset
python Node2Vec/run_node2vec.py -- dataset DBLP
python DegUIL.py --dataset DBLP --mu 0.01 --lr 1e-3
```
or
```sh
bash run.sh
```

### Note: 
Each dataset in datasets/ includes two original adjacency matrices `adj_s.pkl` and  `adj_t.pkl`, 
their corresponding node embeddings generated by node2vec, are saved as `emb_n2v1.pkl`. 
To run the code on **your own datasets**, please refer to utils/data_process.py to process the corresponding datasets into the input format.
